Pioneer has also gone through some rececnt [bans](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/december-4-2023-banned-and-restricted-announcement) on December 4th shaking up the format even more than modern. There was two bannings which was speculated on from the recent pre-announcement from wizards on twitch(video below). The two banned cards were, [Karn, the Great Creator](https://scryfall.com/card/war/1/karn-the-great-creator) and [Geological Appraiser](https://scryfall.com/card/lci/150/geological-appraiser). Karn was part of the Mono-Green Devotion deck that ramped up its mana using [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://scryfall.com/card/ths/223/nykthos-shrine-to-nyx) to gain an insurmountable advantage. As for Geological Appraiser it had a broken Dicover mechanic which a lot of players see as improvement in an already mechanic of cascade. This would allow a player to also gain a big advantage in either double spelling or staying even in card advantage. 

Perhaps the biggest announcement was a rare unbanning, WoTC do not typicall employ this change in formats but when they do for a powerful card it shakes up the format in very unperdictable ways. The powerful card that they unbanned was [Smuggler's Copter](https://scryfall.com/card/nec/160/smugglers-copter). Smuggler's Copter is a powerful card that helps power-up midrange and creature decks with smoothing out their draws while having a very efficent, evasive, and strong beater.

With specifically with the banning of Karn; Copter can thrive in this now cracked open metagame. This is also happening with the U.S Regional Championship in Atlanta happening in basically a week.

## The deck I will play for RC Atlanta

#### Why am I choosing Rakdos Sacrifice?

The biggest reason I am choosing to play Rakdos Sacrifice is because I believe it is the best Copter deck to combat other Copter deck put simply.
