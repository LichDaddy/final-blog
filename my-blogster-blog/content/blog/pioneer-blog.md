Modern has gone through some rececnt [bans](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/december-4-2023-banned-and-restricted-announcement) on December 4th shaking up the format the deck I played was effected with the recent ban on [Fury](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/126/fury). What does this mean for the format? Well it is my belief that creature decks are going to be more playable in the format. What conclusion do I draw from this? I believe the most powerful thing that you can be doing is the clear winner from this ban that was being oppressed by the card [Fury](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/126/fury) which is the [Yawgmoth](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/116/yawgmoth-thran-physician) deck.
