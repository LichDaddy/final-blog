Modern has gone through some rececnt [bans](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/december-4-2023-banned-and-restricted-announcement) on December 4th shaking up the format the deck I played was effected with the recent ban on [Fury](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/126/fury). What does this mean for the format? Well it is my belief that creature decks are going to be more playable in the format. What conclusion do I draw from this? I believe the most powerful thing that you can be doing is the clear winner from this ban that was being oppressed by the card [Fury](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/126/fury) which is the [Yawgmoth](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/116/yawgmoth-thran-physician) deck.

This is version of the deck was created by [YungDingo](https://twitter.com/YungDingoMTG).

## What does this deck do?

The main function of this deck is a combo deck with [Yawgmoth](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/116/yawgmoth-thran-physician), [undying creatures](https://scryfall.com/card/dka/134/young-wolf), and a [blood artist](https://scryfall.com/card/sld/42/blood-artist). You can loop these cards to drain your opponent for life infnitely as long as your life total is more than 1. Additionally, it can play a somewhat fair game plan by accruing value througout the game and beating your opponent down with your creatures.
