Modern has gone through some rececnt [bans](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/december-4-2023-banned-and-restricted-announcement) on December 4th shaking up the format the deck I played was effected with the recent ban on [Fury](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/126/fury). What does this mean for the format? Well it is my belief that creature decks are going to be more playable in the format. What conclusion do I draw from this? I believe the most powerful thing that you can be doing is the clear winner from this ban that was being oppressed by the card [Fury](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/126/fury) which is the [Yawgmoth](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/116/yawgmoth-thran-physician) deck. 

## Yamgmoth

This is version was 

Bold: **This text is bold**.

Italics: _This text is italics_.

Strikethrough: You can ~~strikethrough~~ text.

Inline code: You can add inline code like this `const hello = "world"`.

## Headings

The following HTML `<h2>`â€”`<h6>` elements represent five levels of section headings. `<h1>` is also available but not recommended since the post title is already a `<h1>` element it is not a good practice to have more than one `<h1>` elements in a page.

## H2: Heading Two

### H3: Heading Three

#### H4: Heading Four

##### H5: Heading Five

###### H6: Heading Six

## Paragraph

A standalone single paragraph of text.

Paragraphs can be multiline too when they constitute words that make up more than one line, i.e they wrap to the next line. Wow! I am really smart to write two lines of text that makes zero sense.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. And it's pretty long too. Long enough to wrap to next line. Surely it will wrap.

> You can use other Markdown syntax like `inline code` within a blockquote.
