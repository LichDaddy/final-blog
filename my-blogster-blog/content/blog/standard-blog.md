The Standard format is a format that encompasses all the cards from the last 3 years of sets. I have only played Standard a handful of times this year and do not know what particularly is going on in this format. Because of this I am going to play what I think is the most powerful deck in the format that has been around for a while and I roughly understand its play patterns.

### Overview

Esper Midrange is a powerful deck that leverages some of the most powerful legendary creatures in the Standard Format. The two specific legendary creatures are [Raffine, Scheming Seer](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/213/raffine-scheming-seer) & [Sheoldred, the Apocalypse](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/107/sheoldred-the-apocalypse). Additionally this deck is very good at playing on curve and has a good amount of flexible creautres and reactive spells to keep opponents off balance as you enact your game plan an beat them down.
